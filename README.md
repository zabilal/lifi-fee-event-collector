@mindrunner and @H3xept, PLease i need your help and guide as i cant reach out to Marine who has happens to be out of office.

I have been having this issue, which i can't seem to solve as i have gone into npmjs directory of lifi and found nothing.

The sample utility code in the assignment makes use of a library "lifi-contract-types". I have been trying to install that in my project but to no avail.

Can you kindly help confirm from the engineering team if they can point me to this library or its alternative in case its has been replaced.

Thanks Team
